# UDP-Server-Client-Python1
A simple Client-Server interaction model applying Socket Programming in Python. Uses User Datagram Protocol(UDP). The Server script should be executed first so that it is ready to receive. The Client script is then executed and a string is sent to the server in lower case. The Server receives the message, converts the string to Uppercase and returns it to the Client which prints it.
